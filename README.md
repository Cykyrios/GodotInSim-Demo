# Godot InSim Demo

This demo aims to provide a quick introduction to the [GodotInSim](https://github.com/Cykyrios/GodotInSim) implementation of Live For Speed's InSim protocol.  
The demo can connect to InSim (remember to have LFS listen to the appropriate port), and send random lights and switches packets, as demonstrated below.
